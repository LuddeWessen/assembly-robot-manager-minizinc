% Constraint 8 of CPAIOR-paper (As suggested by reviewer)

%0, x, y | x < y
%1, x, y | x >= y

int: max_lo = max(location_order);
var 0..max_lo: left_max;

constraint forall(p in ACTUAL_TASKS) (
  if p in FIXTURE_TASKS then
    true

    let { array[int] of int: ws_lin_separation_raw = [

    if x = 1 then

%Equivalent to above, and about same speed:
%constraint forall(n in ACTUAL_TASKS diff FIXTURE_TASKS)(agent[n] == 1 <-> location_order[location[n]] <= left_max);

%Constraint (8) should enforce that the two arms do not collide when each of them performing a task from non-sharable zones.
% The stated constraint is time-independent when the tasks are executed.
% This seems to be too restricted and may lead to a removal of feasible solutions.
% As is, this constraint will partition the non-sharable locations into two sets,
% each set containing locations that only can be access from one arm.
