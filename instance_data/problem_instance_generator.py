from problem_printer import ProblemPrinter

# This script generates data for multi capacity dual arm robot assembly application
# There built in assumptions are given in the paper XYZ.
# In short, if an object is picked with tool it has to be put down using the same tool
# Every pick task that requires suction cup, generates a camera task and a place task, and a press task (to be done in that order)
# Every pick task that requires gripper, generates a place task, and a press task (to be done in that order)
# Press tasks requires empty gripper, since the gripper will be used to "press"
# Components are stacked sequentially on fixture 1 and fixture 2,
# then the sub-assembly of fixture 1 is picked up and merged with the sub-assembly of fixture 2.
# It is then picked up, and moved to output location.

# To fully define a problem one needs to give the tasks, which tool they are handled with,
# which order they are assembled on the two fixtures.
# This is done by providing two lists of numbers.
# One list represents the order of assembly of components on one fixture,
# the value of each number represents which tool handled that component.

# Here, we concatenate these two lists, by intersecting the two lists with a -1.
# Given that 0 is gripper (G), and 1 is suction cup (1), the following string:
# [G,S,-1,S,G] represents a problem,
# where component 1 and 4 are picked by gripper,
# and component 2 amd 3 are handled by suckion cup.
# component 2 is placed atop component 1 on fixture 1,
# and component 4 is placed atop component 3 on fixture 2,
# (followed by the picking of sub-assembly of fixture 1, and placing it on fixture 2, as this is always the case)

# Running this script will generate the problem instances of the paper XYZ
