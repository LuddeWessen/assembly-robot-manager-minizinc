% In short (omitting camera tasks, press tasks and tools to use ):
% The robot arms pick 4 components (task 1-4),
% then place 2 components of fixture 1 (task 7 then 9), and 2 components on fixtrue 2 (task 10 then 8).
% Then picks the resulting sub-assembly (task 5) and places it on fixture 2 (task 11).
% Then the resulting assembly is picked (task 6) and is placed on output tray (task 12).



% Durations of tasks (columns) for each agent (rows)
task_durations = [|24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 28, 30,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8
                  |25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 29, 31,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9
                  |];

% Interesting subsets of tasks
TRAY_TASKS = 1..4; % pick tasks performed at component trays (as opposed to picking sub-assembly and assembly from fixtures)
CAMERA_TASKS = 13..14; % camera tasks, used for calibration of object pose in robot tool
OUTPUT_TASKS = { 12 }; % singleton set, consisting of the output task

% The tasks that require empty gripper tool (similar sets could be interesting for suction tool, or requiring tool to hold item, but for this work such sets are not needed)
empty_gripper_tasks = 15..19;

% The pick-and-place task orderings involving gripper tool.
% Each row is one such ordering, and each row is padded with -1 until matrix shape is achieved.
% These orderings require tasks to be performed on the same arm

% The pick-and-place task orderings involving suction cup tool.
% Each row is one such ordering, and each row is padded with -1 until matrix shape is achieved.
% These orderings require tasks to be performed on the same arm

|4, 14, 10, -1

% The fixture task orderings.
% Each row is one such ordering, and each row is padded with -1 until matrix shape is achieved.
% These orderings does not require tasks to be performed on the same arm
